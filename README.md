# ExchangeRateApi
A Springboot application for collecting real-time and historical currency exchange rates. This RESTful service provides access to collect actual exchange rates with support for 33 global currencies with an external REST service via RestTemplate at scheduled time periods. The goal is to provide data exchange communication between REST services and to change an aproach on the data persistance from storing POJO (Plain Old Java Object) as a set of values to an entity that also records the data changes.
